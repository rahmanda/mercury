# Mercury
Mercury is chrome extension which enables you to convert JSON into CSV without hassle. All you need to do is to provide valid JSON array text.

> Data is like gold, it is more valuable if it has been refined from raw form.

Features:
1. Starting Point: If your array is deep inside JSON object, you can add starting point keys so Mercury can find it.
2. Filter Keys: You can add filter keys if you want to get subset keys of object in array. Filter can also be used to generate default value for object which has no certain key.
3. Download CSV: Add filename and hit the button. Your browser will automatically download the generated CSV for you.
